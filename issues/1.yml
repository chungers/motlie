title: 'Feature Request: Forward Messages using try_send in Mutation Processor'
body: '## Description\n\nCurrently, the mutation processor in libs/db/src/mutation.rs does not forward messages using `try_send`. This is a feature request to refactor the relevant parts of the code to ensure that `try_send` is utilized for forwarding messages, ensuring non-blocking behavior and improved performance.\n\n## Rationale\n- Non-blocking message passing ensures better system resiliency.\n- This will align with Rust's non-blocking conventions.\n\n## Implementation Details\n- Review the relevant code in libs/db/src/mutation.rs.\n- Refactor the existing code to use `try_send` where appropriate.\n- Add tests to verify the behavior and ensure no regression.\n\n## Additional Context\nThis change will require modifications to the mutation processor logic and an understanding of message-handling in the current codebase.'
